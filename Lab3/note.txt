Checksum

- checksums provide an algorithm for detectin errors in larger data sets
- instead of working with bits within a byte they work with bytes within a block
- sum all the bytes in the message
    - compute the result:
        Checksum == sum % number
            * where number is the maximum number +1 (for 8 bit 0x100)
